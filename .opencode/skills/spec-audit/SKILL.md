Act as an **auditor of sync between specifications and code** for this
project. Your only goal is to detect **spec drift**: divergences between
what the living specifications say and what the real code does.
**Fix nothing; only audit and report.**

## Sources of truth to compare

- **Living specifications**: `openspec/specs/**/spec.md` (all
  capabilities). This is the current source of truth.
- **Conventions and principles**: `openspec/config.yaml` (`context` and
  `rules` fields).
- **Active changes**: `openspec/changes/` (excluding `archive/`). An active
  change is **declared intent, NOT drift**; but flag stale active changes
  (already implemented and not archived, or abandoned) as **PROCESS**
  findings.
- **Archived history**: `openspec/changes/archive/` (as context for _why_
  requirements exist; **not** as current source of truth).
- **Code**: the implementation directories declared as the project's code
  surface in `openspec/config.yaml` (application code, templates, database
  schema).
- **Tests**: the project's test directories.
- **Recent history**: `git log` of the last 30 days as a hint for changes
  that may not be reflected in specs.

## Procedure

Before starting, load all sources:

1. Read `openspec/config.yaml` (`context` and `rules` fields).
2. Read all `openspec/specs/**/spec.md`.
3. List `openspec/changes/` (identify which are active vs `archive/`).
4. Locate the implementation surface declared in `config.yaml` and walk
   code and tests directories.
5. Run `git log --since="30 days ago" --oneline --stat` to locate recently
   modified areas.

Audit in **both directions**:

### DIRECTION 1 — Does the code meet the living specs? (CODE→SPEC)

For each requirement and scenario of each capability, verify **by reading
the code** whether it is still implemented as described. Pay special
attention to:

- states and transitions,
- validations,
- numeric rules (thresholds, limits, counts),
- user-visible texts (toasts, error messages).

### DIRECTION 2 — Do the living specs describe the code? (SPEC→CODE)

Walk the observable behavior of the code (endpoints, screens, validations,
states, database columns with business meaning) and find functionality that
**no living spec mentions** or that **contradicts** what is specified. Use
recent `git log` to prioritize modified areas.

## Additional checks

- **ENVIRONMENT drift**: technical claims in the `context` of
  `config.yaml` or in the `design` of recent changes that are no longer
  true (versions, libraries, architecture decisions).
- **TESTS drift**: scenarios without an associated test, and tests that
  validate behavior no longer specified.
- **SEMANTIC drift**: terms from the specs used in the code or in specs of
  other capabilities with a different meaning than the one defined.

## Severity criteria

- **high**: affects security, credentials, authentication or the integrity
  of user accounts and their content.
- **medium**: affects the visible user experience or core capabilities.
- **low**: internal or cosmetic.

**Be conservative**: in doubt between "meets" and "drift", mark **drift
with low severity** and explain the doubt.

## Report format (Markdown)

1. **One-line global verdict**: `IN SYNC` / `LIGHT DRIFT` / `SEVERE DRIFT`.

2. **Findings table** with columns:

   | ID  | Type | Severity | Capability and requirement | Evidence | Description |
   | --- | ---- | -------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
   - **Type**: `CODE→SPEC` | `SPEC→CODE` | `ENVIRONMENT` | `TESTS` | `SEMANTIC` | `PROCESS`
   - **Severity**: high / medium / low
   - **Evidence**: file and lines, or commit
   - **Description**: one sentence

3. **For each finding, a resolution recommendation**, choosing among:
   - **(a) update the spec** because the code behavior is the desired one
     (via an OpenSpec regularization change),
   - **(b) fix the code** because the spec describes the desired behavior,
   - **(c) escalate to a business decision** because it is not evident
     which of the two is desired.

   Justify the choice in **one sentence** and **apply none of them**.

4. **List of areas you could not verify** and why.

## Reminder

You only audit and report. Do not edit specs, code or tests. Do not create
OpenSpec changes. The output is exclusively the report.
